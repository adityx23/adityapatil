# Projects

## 1) MuJoCo-Based Robotic Manipulator Simulation (UR10e)
**What it is:** Physics-based simulation to study manipulator control behavior and rollout stability.  
**Focus:** dynamics, control, rollout analysis, simulation-to-real thinking.  
**Tools:** MuJoCo, Python, control theory.

> Coming soon: architecture diagram, controller notes, rollout plots.

## 2) Closed-Loop Thermostat Control System (TMP117)
**What it is:** Discrete-time feedback control using weighted temperature history (non-PID) implemented on embedded hardware.  
**Focus:** control equation, hysteresis logic, stability and noise behavior.  
**Tools:** Embedded C/C++, TMP117 sensor.

> Coming soon: control equation + response plots.

## 3) SLAM-Based Autonomous Navigation Robot
**What it is:** Mobile robot autonomy pipeline with mapping/localization/navigation and system-level testing.  
**Focus:** integration, failure modes, robustness.  
**Tools:** ROS2, Nav2, EKF, Raspberry Pi, ESP32.

> Coming soon: node graph + pipeline diagram.
