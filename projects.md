## 2) Closed-Loop Thermostat Control System (TMP117)
**What it is:** Discrete-time feedback control using weighted temperature history (non-PID) implemented on embedded hardware.  
**Focus:** control equation, hysteresis logic, stability and noise behavior.  
**Tools:** Embedded C/C++, TMP117 sensor.

> Coming soon: control equation + response plots.
