## Highlights

- **SLAM-Based Autonomous Navigation Robot (ROS2 + Nav2 + Cartographer)**  
  Designed and integrated a full mobile robot autonomy stack using LiDAR, IMU, encoder feedback, and ESP32 motor control. Implemented SLAM, localization, and autonomous exploration with simulation-first validation in Gazebo.

- **Embedded Closed-Loop Temperature Control System (Discrete-Time Compensator)**  
  Modeled enclosure thermal dynamics, designed a continuous-time compensator, discretized using Tustin transform, and deployed a difference-equation controller on Arduino Mega controlling PWM-driven Peltier modules.

- **MuJoCo-Based Robotic Manipulator Simulation (UR10e, FK/IK Control)**  
  Implemented forward and inverse kinematics controllers under position and velocity modes in MuJoCo, analyzing trajectory convergence, stability, and task-space motion behavior.
