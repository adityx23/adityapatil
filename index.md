## Robotics & Mechatronics Graduate Student

I design and integrate robotic systems across **simulation, control, and embedded hardware**, with a focus on full-stack autonomy — from physics-based modeling to real-time deployment.

My work spans:

- Mobile robot autonomy (ROS2, SLAM, Nav2)
- Manipulator simulation and kinematic control (MuJoCo)
- Embedded control systems implemented on real hardware

## Highlights

**Mobile Robotics Autonomy (ROS2 + SLAM + Nav2)**  
Designed and integrated a full mobile robot autonomy stack using LiDAR, IMU, encoder feedback, Cartographer SLAM, Nav2 navigation, and ESP32-based motor control. Validated architecture in Gazebo simulation prior to hardware deployment.

**Embedded Closed-Loop Control on Hardware (Non-PID Controller)**  
Modeled thermal dynamics, designed a continuous-time compensator, discretized it using Tustin transform, and implemented the resulting difference-equation controller on Arduino Mega controlling Peltier modules via PWM.

**Manipulator Simulation and Kinematic Control (MuJoCo, UR10e)**  
Implemented and evaluated forward and inverse kinematics control strategies under position and velocity command modes in a physics-based simulation, analyzing motion stability and trajectory behavior.
